# DelayTube
A Chrome extension that helps you watch intentionally, not impulsively.

---

## What is this?

**DelayTube** intercepts your YouTube clicks and saves the video to your **Watch Later** playlist instead of playing it immediately.
It gives you a second thought — a small nudge to ask:
> “Do I really want to watch this now?”

---

## Features

- Intercepts clicks on video thumbnails or titles across YouTube (Home, Subscriptions, Search, Channel pages, etc.)
- **Relaxation Periods**: Let videos play instantly during pre-defined times (e.g., *Friday 8–10pm*)
- Toggle support per page type (Home, Search, Channel, Playlists...)
- No external APIs, accounts, or data collection — works entirely on your local browser
- Simple, clean, and fully customizable

## Options

Click the **Extension Options** page to:

* Enable/disable DelayTube per YouTube section
* Add relaxation time windows (like *Sundays 3–5pm*) where clicking plays the video normally

## Chrome Web Store

> *Coming soon* — or install from source using the instructions above.

---

## Privacy

DelayTube stores all your preferences locally using Chrome's `sync` storage.
It does **not** track, collect, or send *any* data anywhere.
